Analysis Overview

Visualizing Stock Prices and SMAs:
We create plots displaying Apple's historical adjusted close prices alongside SMA30 and SMA100, aiding stakeholders in understanding price trends relative to these moving averages.

Buy and Sell Signal Logic:
We define a function to generate buy and sell signals based on the SMA30 and SMA100 relationship, tracking prices, holding status, and actions, reflecting past trading decisions.

Applying Buy and Sell Signals:
We apply the buy and sell signal logic to our stock data, adding columns for "Buy Price," "Sell Price," "Hold," and "Actions," indicating transaction points based on moving averages.

Buy points are strategically placed to optimize market entry for potential gains.
